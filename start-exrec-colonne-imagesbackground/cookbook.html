    <h2>A Black Cod by any other name is a Sablefish</h2>

        <h3>Words and pictures by Lara Ferroni</h3>
        <p>Or a Candlefish, Coalfish, Bluefish or perhaps the most descriptive, a Butterfish. So many names for one
            tasty fish! Black Cod has to be one of the simplest fish to prepare and still turn out restaurant-worthy.
            Chubby Hubby's blog first enlightened me to the ease of making a mind-blowingly delicious miso cod recipe.
            The moist, delicate flakes of the fish simply slide apart, somehow maintaining the perfect balance between
            smooth and firm.</p>

        <h3>Rustic Cherry Pie</h3>
        <p>My mom isn't a cake person. Growing up, our celebration treats were always pies, cupcakes were the closest
            thing to a birthday cake that she'd attempt, and then only under duress.</p>
    
    
    
        <h3>Hot Asparagus Dip</h3>
        <p>Here's a little spin on artichoke dip. Use asparagus instead. The result? Still creamy, but a bit more
            pungent and green, nutritionally excellent and easier to prepare.</p>
    
    
        <h3>Rhubarb Scone Cake</h3>
        <p>These are scones for the person who can't be bothered to make cute little triangles. Simply roll the dough
            out flat, smear on the fruit, roll and bake. And, what do you get for being this lazy? Gorgeous swirls in a
            tender crumb.</p>
    
        <h3>Nancy's Pasta with Greens</h3>
        <p>I was emotionally scarred by cooked greens. Greasy, mushy mustard and collard greens with overtones of lysol
            and sweat socks, any redeeming qualities long since boiled out.</p>
    
        <h3>Sesame Noodles with Cucumber</h3>
        <p>I always forget about tahini. I'm not sure why, when I have it, I'm always fond of the mild but nutty flavor.
            Sure, it's a touch paste-like. But paired with the right herbs or some chili flakes, it's a fantastic lower
            note.</p>
        <h3>Spring Veggie Tart</h3>
        <p>It has been well over a month since I've posted about a tart! I am going through tart-withdrawl, so last
            weekend whipped up this simple spring vegetable tart, with fresh, organic local asparagus, garlic shoots and
            morels that I picked up at Pike Place market.</p>

        <h3 class="aaaa">Baked Strawberry Pudding</h3>
        <p>What to do with those beautiful strawberries that you bought, and sadly didn't use, right before you went out
            of town for a long weekend? Still very delicious, they are no longer looking their absolute best. Cooking
            seemed like the best answer for the not-quite-perfectly gorgeous pint sitting in my fridge this morning. I
            hadn't made a baked pudding in a while, and while I couldn't find a recipe anywhere for a strawberry baked
            pudding, the Passionfruit Pudding recipe in bills food presented itself as a good starting point.</p>
